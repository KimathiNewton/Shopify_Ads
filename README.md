# Shopify Data Extractor and Metrics Calculator
This Python script extracts data and calculates metrics from a Shopify store. It utilizes the Shopify API and Flask web framework.

## Setup:

Replace the placeholder values in the script with your actual Shopify app credentials:

* CLIENT_ID

* CLIENT_SECRET

* REDIRECT_URI (This should match the redirect URI configured in your Shopify app settings)

Run the script:
```
python app.py
```

This will start the Flask development server and listen for requests on http://127.0.0.1:5000/.

## Extracting Data:

Visit http://127.0.0.1:5000/start in your web browser to initiate the OAuth flow for authentication with Shopify.
Follow the on-screen instructions to grant access to your Shopify store.
Upon successful authorization, the script will extract data and calculate metrics for the specified date range (start_date and end_date in the script).
The extracted data with calculated metrics will be saved to a JSON file named data.json.


## Functionality:

* Connects to a Shopify store using the Shopify API.
* Extracts data from the store based on predefined criteria.
* Calculates relevant metrics based on the extracted data.
* Saves the extracted data and calculated metrics to a JSON file.

## Benefits:

* Provides a quick and automated way to retrieve data from your Shopify store.
* Simplifies data analysis by calculating key metrics like average order value and customer behavior.
* Saves the results in a structured format (JSON) for further use or integration with other tools.


## How it Works:

* Authentication: The script initiates an OAuth flow to authenticate with your Shopify store. You'll need to provide your app's credentials (Client ID, Client Secret) and configure the redirect URI.
* Data Extraction: Once authorized, the script fetches data from various Shopify API endpoints. These endpoints can be customized to target specific data points like sales figures, order details, customer information, and product listings.
* Metrics Calculation: The script calculates essential metrics based on the extracted data. This might include Average Order Value (AOV), items per order, repeat customer rate, and new customer acquisition rate.
* Data Storage: The script saves the extracted data along with the calculated metrics in a JSON file named "data.json". This provides a structured format for further analysis or integration with other applications.

## Customization:

* You can modify the endpoints list in the extract_data function to specify the data you want to fetch from the Shopify API.
* The script currently saves the data to a JSON file. You can modify it to integrate with your desired data storage solution.
